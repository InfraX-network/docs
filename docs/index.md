# InfraX Network

The InfraX Network is a decentralized network of Nodes that can be used to run Apps. The network is designed to be fault-tolerant and scalable, with the ability to run multiple Apps concurrently.

## Nodes

A [Node](node.md) is a computer that is connected to the InfraX network. Nodes are responsible for running Apps and processing Jobs. They are the backbone of the InfraX network.

## Apps

An [App](app.md) is a python application that is installed on a Node in the InfraX network. It is used to execute user created [Jobs](job.md) and interact with the InfraX network.

## Jobs

A [Job](job.md) is a user-created task that is executed by an App on a Node in the InfraX network. It is used to process input data and generate output data.
