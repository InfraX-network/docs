A Node is the working unit of the InfraX network. It is a computer that is connected to the network and is used to execute user created [Jobs](job.md) against active [Apps](app.md).

## Getting Started

To get started with contributing to the InfraX network as a node supplier, you will need to install and run the InfraX Node software on your computer. You can download the latest version of the software from the public [github repository](https://github.com/wegfawefgawefg/infrax-gpu-router-backend).

## Installation

To install the InfraX Node software, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Edit the `config.toml` file to match your information.
3. Run the `install.sh` script to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run the `start.sh` script to start the InfraX Node software.
5. Your node is now connected to the InfraX network and ready to install Apps and receive Jobs.

## Usage

Once your node is connected to the InfraX network, requests to install Apps and run Jobs will be sent to your node. You can view the status of your node and the Jobs that are currently running by visiting the InfraX dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while installing or running the InfraX Node software, please refer to the [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md) for assistance.
